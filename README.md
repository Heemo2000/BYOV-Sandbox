It is a very small prototype which contains nothing other than accessing vehicle and podium.
I have used design pattern ServiceLocator for the first time.

Plus I have learned how to handle different inputs for different interactable objects.

Controls:
<br>
WASD/Arrow keys: Move character/Vehicle
<br>
E: Interact
<br>
Left Ctrl: Throttle
